		"request": "SCDRC or NCDRC passes the orders for a refund of money in the dispute between the buyer and developer",
		"right": "The respondent filed a consumer complaint before the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2011 praying for possession of the Row House and in the alternative for the refund of the amount paid to the developer together with interest at 12% per annum. Compensation of Rs 20 lakhs was also claimed.  The SCDRC allowed the complaint by directing the appellant to refund the moneys paid by the respondent together with interest at 12% per annum and compensation of Rs 5 lakhs.  The NCDRC has modified this order by reducing the compensation from Rs 5 lakhs to Rs 2 lakhs.",
		"wrong": "The essential aspect of the case which is required to be analysed is whether the buyer was entitled to seek a refund or was estopped from doing so, having claimed compensation as the primary relief in the consumer complaint. The Buyer’s Agreement is dated 2 July 2007. In terms of the agreement, the date for handing over possession was 31 December 2008, with a grace period of six months. Even in 2011, when the buyer filed a consumer complaint, he was ready and willing to accept possession. It would be manifestly unreasonable to construe the contract between the parties as requiring the buyer to wait indefinitely for possession. By 2016, nearly seven years had elapsed from the date of the agreement. Even according to the developer, the completion certificate was received on 29 March 2016. This was nearly seven years after the extended date for the handing over of possession prescribed by the agreement. A buyer can be expected to wait for possession for a reasonable period. A period of seven years is beyond what is reasonable. ",
		"intermediate": "In the circumstances, we are of the view that the orders passed by the SCDRC and by the NCDRC for refund of moneys were justified.   Having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, we modify the order of the NCDRC by directing that the appellant shall pay interest at the rate of 9% per annum to the respondent instead and in place of 12% as directed by the NCDRC. Save and except for the above modification, we affirm the directions of the NCDRC. The amount outstanding in terms of the directions of this Court shall be released out of the moneys which have been deposited by the appellant. The balance, if any, that remains shall be refunded to the appellant."

		"request": "the buyer agreement considered one-sided",
		"right": "Under the aforesaid clause, any delay beyond 30 June 2009 would result in the developer being required to pay interest at the prevailing savings bank interest of the State Bank of India. Interestingly, where the buyer is in default, the agreement stipulates that interest at the rate of 18 per cent from the date of default until the date of payment would be charged for a period of two months, failing which the allotment would be cancelled by deducting 5% of the entire value of the property. The agreement was evidently one sided. For a default on the part of the buyer, interest at the rate of 18% was liable to be charged. However, a default on the part of the developer in handing over possession would make him liable to pay interest only at the savings bank rate prescribed by the SBI. There is merit in the submission which has been urged by the buyer that the agreement was one sided. ",
		"wrong": "This appeal arises from the judgment dated 21 November 2016 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.  A Buyer’s Agreement dated 2 July 2007 was entered into between the appellant and the respondent.  The respondent paid an amount of Rs 39,29,280 in 2006 in terms of a letter of allotment dated 20 September 2006. The agreement between the parties envisaged that the appellant would hand over possession of a Row House to the respondent by 31 December 2008 with a grace period of a further six months ending on 30 June 2009. a settlement was arrived on 11 September 2018 before the NCDRC specifying the date on which possession would be handed over together with interest at 6% per annum instead of 4% as mentioned in the Buyers’ Agreement. It was urged that the developer having made a substantial investment in terms of the agreement, a direction for refund is not warranted. ",
		"intermediate" :"While considering the rival submissions, we must at the outset advert to the following clause which was contained in the Buyer’s Agreement:  “Unless prevented by circumstances beyond the control of the company and subject to Force Ma jeure, KWIC shall ensure to complete the said unit in all respect within 31st December 2008 only for the Cluster D. Further there will be a grace period of 6 months (up to 30th June, 2009) from the date of completion. In case the possession is not transferred after expiry of the said grace period, KWIC will be liable to pay prevailing saving Bank interest of the State Bank of India for each month of delay on the money given by the allottee as compensation but no compensation will be paid on account of force majeure reasons.”  It is the above clause which is pressed in aid by the developer. Under the aforesaid clause, any delay beyond 30 June 2009 would result in the developer being required to pay interest at the prevailing savings bank interest of the State Bank of India. "

		"request": "recorded confession of the accused is a weak piece of evidence",
		"right": "That brings us to the confessional statement of the appellant recorded by PW-1. Admittedly, this confession was recorded after the appellant was arrested. It is true that the issue, whether a statement recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act can be construed as a confessional statement even if the officer who has recorded such statement was not to be treated as a police officer, has been referred to a larger Bench in the case of Tofan Singh v. State of Tamil Nadu.   We, for the decision of this case, therefore, proceed on the premise that the confession is admissible. Even if it is admissible, the Court has to be satisfied that it is a voluntary statement, free from any pressure and also that the accused was apprised of his rights before recording the confession. No such material has been brought on the record of this case. It is also well settled that a confession, especially a confession recorded when the accused is in custody, is a weak piece of evidence and there must be some corroborative evidence. The confession of the co-accused, which was said to be a corroborative piece of evidence, has been discussed above and is of no material value. ",
		"wrong": " As far as the appellant is concerned, he was convicted for having committed offences under Section 8(c) read with 29, 21 and 23(c) and 27(A) of the NDPS Act and apart from that appellant had committed the offence punishable under Section 8(c) read with 27(A) of the Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 15 years and to pay fine of Rs.1,50,000/- and in default of payment to undergo simple imprisonment for one year. Offence under Section 27A of the Act relates to punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders  The essential ingredient of this offence is that the prosecution must prove that the accused has financed directly or indirectly any of the activities falling in sub-clause (i) to (v) of Clause (viiia) of Section 2 of the Act or has harbored any person engaged for the aforesaid activities. As far as the case of the prosecution is concerned, it is only of financing and not of harboring.  This is basically an offence for exporting or importing into India or exporting from India contraband substance. Though, the charges against the appellant were of financing and of indulging in international smuggling of contraband, virtually no evidence in this regard has been found. ",
		"intermediate": "As far as the present appellant is concerned, the only evidence, if it can be called that, is the statement of a co-accused (accused no.2) and his own alleged confession. Even if we take the confession of the co accused Hasan Mohamed (A-2) into consideration, it would only prove that Mohammed (from Bombay) had told the co accused that Nalliappan would handover the contraband to the present appellant. This evidence of a co-accused is a very weak type of evidence which needed to be corroborated by some other evidence. The confession of a co-accused gives a clue to the investigating authorities as to how to investigate the matter and against whom to investigate the matter. Thereafter, it is for the investigating officers to collect evidence against the said person who has been named by the co-accused. In the present case no such corroborative evidence has been led. Therefore, other than the two confessional statements – one of the co-accused and the other of the accused, the prosecution has gathered no evidence to link the appellant with the commission of the offence. As such, without going into the legality of the admissibility of the confession, we hold that even if these confessions are admissible then also the evidence is not sufficient to convict the accused.

		"request": "fabricated documents lead to age determination of the claimed juvenile",
		"right": "The first respondent took the plea that  he was a juvenile under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)  Act, 2004 on the date of the alleged offence. The counsel appearing on his  behalf filed an application for bail, together with a certificate purported to have  been issued by the Madhyamik Siksha Mandal, Madhya Pradesh pertaining  to the appearance of the first respondent at the high school examination.  The JMFC conducted an inquiry and found that the certificate produced by  the first respondent was fabricated. Therefore, the JMFC directed the police  to register FIR No. 292/2015 dated 20 August 2015 in PS Civil Lines, Satna  under sections 193, 465, 466, 468, and 471 of IPC against the first respondent for intentionally using fabricated documents in judicial proceedings. Due to the non-availability of a document confirming the age of the first  respondent, the 4th Additional Sessions Judge decided to seek a medical  opinion in accordance with rule 12(3)(b) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and  Protection of Children) Rules, 20075. Accordingly, the 4th Additional Sessions  Judge sought the opinion of the District Medical Board, which examined the  first respondent. The District Medical Board opined that the approximate age  of the first respondent was between 17 to 21 years based on medical  evidence and literature. The 4th Additional Sessions Judge calculated the  approximate age of the first respondent as 19 years. Thus, the 4th Additional  Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the first respondent was not a  juvenile on the date of the incident.  The 4th Additional Sessions  Judge doubted the credibility of the birth certificate issued by the municipal  authority because the documents were improperly maintained by the staff and  were also found to be tampered. After due scrutiny, it has been found  that there is no entry of registration bearing entry no. 1545 pertaining to the  date 18 April 2002 and the last entry is entry no 1544. Hence, it is apparent  that the documents placed before the High Court by the first respondent in  support of his claim of juvenility are fabricated and manipulated. Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh has,  it may be noted, also drawn the attention of the Court to the report of the  medical board. It is evident from the report of the medical board that the first  respondent was not a juvenile.",

The appellant, who was a minor at the time  of commission of the offence, alleged that she had been subjected to gang  rape by the first respondent and other persons. The alleged offence is stated  to have taken place about three to four months prior to the registration of the  FIR on 24 July 2015. During the course of the investigation, the first  respondent was arrested along with other accused alleged to be involved in  the commission of the offences.  On 6 August 2015, the first respondent was produced before the Court of the  Judicial Magistrate First Class, Satna3. The first respondent took the plea that  he was a juvenile under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)  Act, 20004 on the date of the alleged offence. The counsel appearing on his  behalf filed an application for bail, together with a certificate purported to have  been issued by the Madhyamik Siksha Mandal, Madhya Pradesh pertaining  to the appearance of the first respondent at the high school examination. The certificate indicated that the date of birth of the first respondent was 30  January 1999.   In the meantime, the police completed the investigation in FIR No. 433/2015  and submitted a charge sheet before the competent court dated 02 November  2015 against the first respondent and six other co-accused persons for  offences punishable under sections 363, 366, 376(2)(vi), 120-B and 506 of  IPC. Thereafter, the police also completed the investigation in FIR No.  292/2015 and filed a charge sheet dated 03 December 2015 against the first    “2007 Rules” respondent and his counsel for offences punishable under sections 193, 465,  466, 468, 471, and 120B of IPC.  The first respondent moved the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in a criminal  revision against the report of the 4th Additional Sessions Judge dated 21  December 2015. The Single Judge, by an order dated 22 August 2016,  allowed the revision and accepted the plea of the first respondent that he was  a juvenile at the time of the lodging of the FIR on 24 July 2015.  In support of the above conclusion, the High Court observed that a  matriculation or equivalent certificate, if it is available, and, in its absence the  date of birth from the school first attended would have to be accepted in the  determination as to whether the first respondent was a juvenile on the date of  the incident. The High Court has proceeded on the basis that the first  respondent was admitted to Class 1 where his date of birth is mentioned as  30 June 1999, which was corroborated by PW-4, the Director of Guardian and  Guide Public School, Satna.

Ltd., in the Delhi High Court was that a petition before the High Court is not maintainable as the dispute relates to an international commercial arbitration, being covered by Section 2(1)(f)(i) of the Arbitration Act inasmuch as the respondents are husband and wife who are both nationals of and habitually resident in the United States of America. an analysis of Section 2(1)(f) would show that whatever be the transaction between the parties, if it happens to be entered into between persons, at least one of whom is either a foreign national, or habitually resident in, any country other than India; or by a body corporate which is incorporated in any country other than India; or by the Government of a foreign country, the arbitration becomes an international commercial arbitration notwithstanding the fact that the individual, body corporate, or government of a foreign country referred to in Section 2(1)(f) carry on business in India through a business office in India. This being the case, it is clear that the Delhi High Court had no jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator in the facts of this case.  ",

A distributorship may be taken up in individual capacity or as a sole proprietorship concern, partnership firm or company. Amway reserves the right to require that Applicants having Non Resident Indian (NRI), Person of Indian Origin (PIO) or Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status operate distributorships via certain types of legal entities.”  “3.14 Legal Entity Distributorships: A Direct Seller may own and operate his or her Distributorship as a sole proprietary concern or registered partnership firm or limited liability  company (LLC), provided it complies with certain requirements and conditions. …”  “3.14.5 The sole business of the legal entity must be the operation of an Amway Distributorship.

		"intermediate": "Shri Parag Tripathi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, has argued that his predecessor’s plea in the High Court was incorrectly turned down in that this case is really governed by Section 2(1) (f)(i) and not by Section 2(1)(f)(iii). Once it is found that a party to an arbitration agreement is an individual who is a national of, or habitually resident in, any country other than India, it is not necessary to go to any other sub-clauses of Section 2(1)(f), and as it is clear that the respondents, who applied to the High Court under Section 11(6), are individuals who are nationals of and habitually resident in the USA, would fall under Section 2(1)(f)(i), the High Court would have no jurisdiction, such petition having to be filed only under Section 11(6) read with Section 11(9) to the Supreme Court.   Ms. Manmeet Arora, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, has supported the judgment under appeal, and has referred to various documents which, according to her, make it clear that the respondents, husband and wife, would have to be pigeonholed under “association or body of individuals” under Section 2(1)(f)(iii) and not under Section 2(1)(f)(i). The question lies in a very narrow compass. As rightly contended by Ms. Arora, the documentary evidence in this case would be decisive of whether the requirements of sub-clause (i) to Section 2(1)(f) have been met, in which case it is unnecessary to go to sub-clause (iii), as under Section 2(1)(f), “at least one of the parties” must fall under sub-clauses (i) to (iv) of Section 2(1)(f).

		"request": "‘enmity’ as a reason to reject the testimony of witnesses",
		"right": "It is an admitted fact that the complainant and the appellants were on enemical terms and some criminal proceedings were pending between them even at the time when the occurrence took place. It is equally true that Bahori, PW 1 is the brother of the deceased and informant. But we are not convinced by the aforesaid arguments that either on account of animosity or on account of relationship they did not divulge the truth but fabricated a false case against the appellants. It is needless to em-phasise that enmity is a double edged sword which can cut both ways. However, the fact remains that whether the prosecution witnesses are close relatives of the deceased victim or on enemical terras with the deceased involved in the crime of murder, the witnesses are always interested to see that the real offenders of the crime are booked and they are not, in any case, expected to leave out the real culprits and rope in the innocent persons simply because of the enmity. It is, therefore, not a safe rule to reject their testimony merely on the ground that the complainant and the accused persons were on enemical terms. Similarly the evidence could not be rejected merely on the basis of relationship of the witnesses with the deceased. ",
		"wrong": "This appeal by special leave of this Court has been directed against the judgment of the High Court of Rajasthan passed in Criminal Appeal No. 285/90 affirming the conviction of the four appellants for an offence under Section 302, I.P.C. by the Additional Sessions Judge, Deeg in Sessions Case No. 8/89; imposing sentence of life imprisonment on all the four appellants (herein).  The four appellants, namely, Arjun, Rampal, Bhagwan Singh and Mukhoram were charged and tried alongwith four other acquitted accused, namely, Nathu, Pannalal, Damodarlal and Badely under Sections 302 and 148 read with Section 149 of the I.P.C.  The prosecution case was that on 27,11.88 at about 11 AM when the  deceased Jyoti Ram followed by his brother Bohari PW 1, was going from his village Baroli Dhau to an adjoining village Pasopa to purchase water pipe, he was way laid and surrounded by the appellants and four other co-accused who emerged from mustard field. The appellants Bhagawan Sahai, Rampal and  Arjun were armed with Farsas and the appellant Mukho Ram was armed with Ballam while the rest of the four acquitted accused are said to be armed with lathies. It is said that the appellant Arjun exhorted the other  accused persons to kill Jyoti Ram then all assaulted Jyoti Ram with the weapons they were armed with. When the assault was opened on Jyoti Ram he raised hue and cry inviting the attention of Puran, PW 3 who was present in the nearby field and Bhagawan Sahai, PW 2, Harish Chandra, PW 4, Sat Pal Singh, PW 7 who had just come out of the Panchayat Bhavan after the  meeting. They all rushed to the place of occurrence to rescue Jyoti Ram. The appellant and the other four acquitted accused on seeing the villagers and witnesses approaching the place of occurrence made their escape good.",
		"intermediate": "The accused Damodar and Panna took the plea of alibi and stated that on the relevant date and time both of them were at Delhi and that they were falsely implicated. The remaining accused also adjured their guilt and pleaded false implication due to enmity. The learned Trial Judge after analysing the prosecution evidence on record found that there were some exaggeration in the prosecution evidence with regard to the accused Damodar and Panna as compared to their statements recorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. and, therefore, giving the benefit of doubt recorded their acquittal. The Trial Judge gave the benefit of doubt to the other two co-accused, namely, Nathu and Badley and, therefore, acquitted them also. The Trial Court found no case against any of the appellants under Section 148.  However, learned Trial Judge on evaluation of the prosecution evidence found it to be reliable and consistent so far as the four appellants before us are concerned and, therefore, held them guilty under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder of Jyoti Ram and sentenced to each one of them to undergo life imprisonment. The said conviction and sentence has been  further affirmed by the High Court of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench against which this appeal by grant of special leave has been preferred,  Learned counsel for the appellants first contended that there was long standing enmity between the complainant and some of the witnesses on one hand and the appellants on the other and some criminal proceedings between them were going on when the alleged incident took place and hence it was due to this enmity that the appellants were falsely implicated. It was also submitted that Bahori, PW 1 and Sat Pal Singh, PW 7 are close relatives of the deceased and other prosecution witnesses are also close associates and, therefore, there is possibility of false implication of the appellants in the crime in question.
